Today I learned bit about Ansible for network automation. 
It's not a big deal of a work but for me I failed so many times just
to save config files because of the old devices with old IOS where 
encryption algorithms don't match etc, but I was so proud of myself 
after I succeeded so I thought about pushing it to repo, also some
exercise for the github.
